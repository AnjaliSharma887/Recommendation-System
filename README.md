Myntra E-commerce Recommendation System using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Introduction

This project focuses on developing a recommendation system for the Myntra e-commerce website using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to recommend the top 5 similar products to customers based on their preferences, inferred from their textual descriptions. By leveraging NLP, we aim to enhance the personalized shopping experience of Myntra users.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and consists of a large collection of product descriptions,product id, brand, title of product and additional metadata. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, such as text cleaning and vectorization, to convert the text data into a suitable format for NLP-based recommendation modeling.

Methodology

The recommendation system was developed using NLP techniques, specifically employing text similarity measures and embeddings. We utilized a combination of pre-trained word embeddings, such as Word2Vec, to represent the textual information of products and customer preferences. Text similarity measures, such as cosine similarity, were employed to identify products with similar descriptions or title of product. The system then ranked and recommended the top 5 similar products based on the inferred customer preferences.

Results

The recommendation system achieved promising results during evaluation. It accurately identified and recommended products that matched the user's preferences. The system successfully provided personalized recommendations for users, enhancing their shopping experience and increasing the likelihood of making relevant purchases.
